# ordering_same_type_files_with_indexes
Suppose picture files taken by camera imported to pc.we can see them in 10 or 12 decimal format ex:2308113267.jpg
By this program we order '.jpg' or '.png'  files by numbering them ,we can also number other extension multiple files having format '.docx','.ppt','.pdf' in the directory 
      It is a simple program written importing os package using only 2 necessary functions #os.listdir() #os.rename(oldfilename,newfilename)
